#  Python Capstone Project - Diwali Sales Analysis - Improve Customer Experience By Analysing Sales Data and Increase Revenue

## Overview

> This Python capstone project serves as a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired during the course. It integrates key concepts such as- data manipulation, visualization, automation and problem-solving using Python. The project focuses on building a real world application or performing an end-to-end data analysis workflow, enabling the practical demonstration of programming capabilities and analytical thinking. [3,20]

## Project Goal

> The primary goal of this project is to apply Python programming to solve a real-world problem or provide actionable insights from data. The project aims to strengthen the understanding of Python libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib etc.), improve coding practices and showcase the ability to desig, implement, and present a complete solution independently. [3, 20]

## Technologies Used

> 1. Python, 2. numpy, 3. pandas, 4. matplotlib and 5. seaborn. [3, 20]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> 1. Python installed (version: 3.12.1)
> 2. Basic understanding of of Python programming (data types, loops, functions etc.)
> 3. Familiarity with libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib/ Seaborn.
> 4. Jupyter Notebook or any similar IDE (such as PyCharm) to run and document the project interactively.

### Installation

> Follow thesteps below to set up the environment and run the project:
> 1. ### Install Python
>    Download and install Python 3.12.1 (3.7 or above) from the official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/
> 2. ### Install an IDE
>    Use any of the following
> 	 * Jupyter Notebook
>	 * PyCharm
>	 * VS Code
> 3. ### Download the Project Repository
>	 Download the project : https://github.com/Rita-Mahato-2025/Diwali_Sales_-Analysis/blob/main/Python_Capstone_Project.ipynb
> 4. ### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
> 	 Run on Git Bash (cmd) : python -m notebook
> 5. Install Required Libraries -  Istall dependencies using pip :
> 	 Run on Git Bash (cmd) : pip install pandas; pip install numpy; pip install matplotlib.pyplot and pip install seaborn;
> 6. Run the project 
>	 * If using Jupyter Notebook : Then open the Notebook file and run cells step by step.

### Usage

> The project helps businesses and analysts gain insights into customer buying behavior during the festive season. By analyzing sales data, the project uncovers patterns such as: 
> * Which age groups or gender contribute most of sales.
> * Top-performing product categories and city segments.
> * Spending trends based on marital status and occupation.
> * Target customer groups for future Diwali campaigns.
>
> This project can be used by :
> Retail Businesses : to improve festive marketing strategies.
> Data Analysts: to practice EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Visualization skills.
> Students as a real-world capstone project to demonstrate Python and data analysis proficiency.

## Further Improvements

> Suggest future improvements or potential features for the project. [3, 20]
